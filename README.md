Your task is to implement a Music Player using React. All of your code should be written in the index.jsx tab; do not modify any of the existing HTML / CSS code!

You are given a template of the Music Player implementation. You need to implement a React component App, which contains a PlayerBar component inside it (which also should be implemented).

The PlayerBar component should consist of the following elements:

A button to play / pause the music
When the button is pressed, the button icon should be changed to the opposite (the play icon should be changed into the pause icon, and vice versa).
A button for skipping to the next song
When the button is pressed, the current song is changed to the next one in the playlist
If the current song was the last one, the first song should be selected after pressing the button (the playlist is cyclic).
A button for returning to the previous song
When the button is pressed, the current song is changed to the previous one.
If the current song was the first one, the last song should be selected after pressing the button.
A display block with the current selected song, containing the artist and the song name
[execution time limit] 60 seconds
